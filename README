Minicomputer is a standalone Linux softwaresynthesizer for
creating experimental electronic sounds as its often used 
in Industrial music.

This is a prerelease version and contains some bugs but 
already worked in studio for my project 'Akustikkoppler' 
and live for 'Notstandskomitee'.

Minicomputer is free open source software.

Its split into the engine and an editor.

Dependancies includes:

- Jack
- FLTK
- Alsaseq

and 

- Scons for building

Take care, it can be harsh! Use it on your own risk, you have been warnend!

For building Minicomputer just type

scons

for building it. Yet missed is an installation routine so put the to files anywhere you need them
