Minicomputer is a standalone Linux softwaresynthesizer for
creating experimental electronic sounds as its often used 
in Industrial music.

This is a prerelease version and contains some bugs but 
already worked in studio for my project 'Akustikkoppler' 
and live for 'Notstandskomitee'.

Minicomputer is free open source software.

Its split into the engine and an editor.

Dependancys includes:

- Jack
- FLTK
- Alsaseq

Take care, it can be harsh! Use it on your own risk, you have been warnend!
