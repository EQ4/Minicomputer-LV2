Minicomputer v. 1.0
Industrial Grade Digital Synthesizer

by Malte Steiner

email: steiner@block4.com

Minicomputer is a standalone Linux softwaresynthesizer for
creating experimental electronic sounds as its often used 
in Industrial music.

This is a 1.0 version and may contain some bugs but 
already worked in studio for my project 'Akustikkoppler' 
and live for 'Notstandskomitee'.

Minicomputer is free open source software.

Its split into the engine and an editor.

Dependancies includes:

- Jack
- FLTK
- Alsaseq
- pthreads
- liblo

and 

- Scons for building

Take care, it can be harsh! Use it on your own risk, you have been warnend!

----------------------------- building Minicomputer ------------------------

For building Minicomputer just type

scons

for building it. Yet missed is an installation routine so put the to files anywhere you need them.
Cleaning the buildfiles but the new created programfiles TOO, is done by typing 

scons -c

The buildprocess accept parameters for refining architecture optimization:

- 64bit=1
forces a build for 64bit platforms with the -m64 option

- k8=1
optimizes for AMD K8 cpus, giving the compilers the -march=k8 -mtune=k8 settings

-k7=1
optimizes for AMD Athlon XP cpus

So a k8 64bit build looks like

scons 64bit=1 k8=1

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- 'I have library xyz installed but scons complains about not finding xyz'
make sure that you have the developer version of the library installed which comes extra and additionally.Usually looks like libxyz.dev


A word to package maintainers:
